# IMBd ratings of all 110 Community (2009 - 2015) episodes

First of all, Community is a gem and if you haven't seen it, you should.

On May 9, 2020 I scraped the IMDb ratings of all 110 [Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)) episodes in honor of their [May 18, 2020 reunion](https://www.cnet.com/news/the-community-reunion-with-donald-glover-is-happening/) to raise money for two coronavirus relief efforts.

### This repo contains the following jupyter notebooks:

`community_data_scrape_process.ipynb` - this notebook explains the scraping process step-by-step, using [this article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/) as a reference (for beginners)

`community_data_scrape.ipynb` - optimized code used for scraping


You can also find the dataset on kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/imbenab/community-episodes-imdb-ratings).
